                            <li><strong>Social learning:</strong> Art becomes a natural setting to practice turn-taking, communication, collaboration, and respect for others' ideas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Growing independence:</strong> Children practice following multi-step directions, making choices, managing materials, and participating in cleanup.</li>
                            <li><strong>Age-appropriate structure:</strong> Short, predictable blocks with a clear routine help children feel safe, focused, and successful.</li>

                        <p>For young children, art isn't just fun — it supports core development and school readiness:</p>
                        <ul class="benefits-list">
                            <li><strong>Fine Motor Skills:</strong> Strengthens hand muscles and coordination needed for writing and everyday self-care</li>
                            <li><strong>Language & Expression:</strong> Builds vocabulary, storytelling, and confidence through describing ideas and artwork</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional Regulation & Confidence:</strong> Supports persistence, flexibility, and pride in one's work</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognitive & School-Readiness Skills:</strong> Encourages attention, planning, sequencing, problem-solving, and flexible thinking</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These benefits are supported by trusted early childhood education research (NAEYC, CDC, and early learning frameworks), which emphasize creative play and process-based art as essential to healthy development.</p>

                        <p>In Object Lab, students examine familiar objects and rethink their function, form, and purpose.</p>

                        <h4>What Happens in Class</h4>
                        <p>Each session focuses on one everyday object — such as a kettle, chair, spoon, bag, or clock.</p>

                            <li><strong>Observe & Interact</strong> — Handle and analyze the object, identify how it works, discuss the problem it solves</li>
                            <li><strong>Define Purpose</strong> — What need does this object address? Who is it designed for? What constraints or trade-offs exist?</li>
                            <li><strong>Ideate & Sketch</strong> — Generate multiple ideas, sketch redesigned versions, add written notes explaining features and purpose</li>
                            <li><strong>Prototype</strong> — Build a functional or structural model using materials such as cardboard, clay, paper, fabric, and found objects</li>
                            <li><strong>Share</strong> — Explain their thinking, describe the problem they aimed to solve, discuss possible improvements</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>In Systems Lab, students design intangible systems — the invisible frameworks that shape how we live, move, and interact.</p>

                        <h4>What Happens in Class</h4>

                            <li><strong>Design Their Own Version</strong> — Modify or redesign the system, clarify new rules and structure</li>
                            <li><strong>Map the Logic</strong> — Diagram how it works step-by-step, identify cause-and-effect relationships</li>

                        <p>At ages 7–10, children are developing stronger logical reasoning and structured thinking. Inventor Studio channels that growth into purposeful creativity.</p>
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Purpose-driven thinking</strong> — identifying real problems and defining clear goals</li>
                            <li><strong>Logical reasoning</strong> — thinking step-by-step and understanding cause and effect</li>
                            <li><strong>Executive function</strong> — planning, organizing, and following through</li>
                            <li><strong>Creative confidence</strong> — turning ideas into tangible solutions</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication skills</strong> — explaining and defending their thinking</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In a world increasingly shaped by automation, the ability to define problems and design thoughtful solutions remains essential. Inventor Studio nurtures those capacities — through making.</p>
